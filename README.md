# 8th Light Programming Challenge

This repository contains my solution to the programming compoment of the 8th Light prescreen assessment. 

## Ingredients

- [Express](expressjs.com) ✈️ because I'd never tried it before.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) ⚛️ because it was in the prompt.
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) 🎁 because why config your bundler...?
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) 📗 because style is hard.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) 💃🏽 because Bulma.
- [Jest](jestjs.io) 🤡 because it's *supposed* to be fun...

## Usage

Run this project and develop it locally.
Please ensure you have the latest versions of node and npm.

(If you use nvm)

```bash
nvm use
```

First, install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Next, build the frontend.

```bash
npm run start-client
```

Open another terminal and run the server.

```bash
npm run start-server
```

Now run tests, if you'd like. But don't get too excited. (See *Reflections* below,)

```bash
npm run test
```

*Coming soon.*
